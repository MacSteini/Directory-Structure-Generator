# Directory Structure Generator

A script compatible with both `zsh` and `bash` to generate a Markdown file outlining the folder and file structure of the directory where the script is executed. The generated structure is presented in a readable Markdown format for easy documentation and sharing.

## Overview

This script generates a Markdown file, `structure.md`, detailing the folder and file hierarchy of the directory in which it is executed. The script excludes itself and its output file from the generated structure, making it ideal for documenting repositories, projects, or file collections.

## Features

- Compatible with **bash** and **zsh**
- Recursively scans folders and files starting from the scriptâ€™s directory
- Outputs a well-structured Markdown file with:
  - **ðŸ“‚ Folder icons**
  - **ðŸ“„ File icons**
- Dynamically adjusts indentation for nested structures
- Automatically excludes the script file and the generated Markdown file

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** macOS or Linux
- **Shell:** _bash_ or _zsh_
- **Tools Required:**
  - `printf`
  - `cd`
  - `basename`

These utilities are included in most Unix-based operating systems.

## Usage Instructions
1. Save and execute the scripts in the chosen directory:
   1. Save the zsh or bash script in the folder with the files to process
   1. Make it executable: `chmod +x ./directory-structure-generator.zsh` resp. `chmod +x directory-structure-generator.sh`
   1. Run the script: `./directory-structure-generator.zsh` resp. `./directory-structure-generator.sh`
1. View the output:
   - The script generates a `structure.md` file in the same directory. Open it with a text or Markdown viewer

## How It Works

1. **Script Execution Detection:**
   - Identifies whether the script is run as a shell command or a script file
1. **Target Folder and Output File Setup:**
   - Automatically sets the target folder to the scriptâ€™s directory
   - Defines the output Markdown file as `structure.md`
1. **Recursive Directory Traversal:**
   - Iterates over all items in the folder recursively
   - Adds folder and file names to the Markdown file with appropriate indentation and icons
1. **Exclusion Rules:**
   - Excludes the script itself and the output file from the generated structure

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied:** Ensure the script has executable permissions: `chmod +x ./directory-structure-generator.zsh` resp. `chmod +x ./directory-structure-generator.sh`
- **Empty Output File:** Verify that the directory contains files and is not empty
- **File Not Found Errors:** Confirm that required commands (`basename`, `printf`, etc.) are installed and available
