# Directory Structure Generator v1.0

# GitHub: https://github.com/macsteini/directory-structure-generator
#
# Description:
# This script generates a Markdown file named "structure.md" that details
# the folder and file hierarchy of the directory where it is executed.
# It intelligently excludes itself and the generated output file from the
# structure. Ideal for documenting project directories and file collections.
#
# Features:
# - Recursively scans directories and files from the scriptâ€™s location.
# - Outputs a well-formatted Markdown file with:
#   - Folder icons (**ðŸ“‚**) for directories
#   - File icons (**ðŸ“„**) for files
# - Dynamically adjusts indentation for nested directories
# - Automatically excludes the script file and the generated output file
#
# Example Usage:
# - Run the script in the desired directory:
#   ./directory-structure-generator.zsh
# - The resulting "structure.md" file will list the hierarchy of files and folders
